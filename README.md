# Dungeon Delve

This project is a remake of my older game created in Pygame. The goal of the game is to navigate through the dungeon, survive, defeat bosses, solve puzzles, and do it all in the fastest time possible. The project was created as part of a Python seminar for high schoolers at MUNI.

## Installation

Before running the game, the following packages need to be installed:

- Pygame
- Python 3.x
- Pygame-gui

or you can install simply all the packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Then, simply run the main.py file.
## How to Play
