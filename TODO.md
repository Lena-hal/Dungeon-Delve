## shelling system
the shelling system is a system for modifiing objects on the go using premade shells, the base object is "Object" and everything else is a "Shell" newer shells rewrite the old shell data if necessery. Shell is something like a class, it adds some functionality based on the shell specification (playble shell adds controls for the player, enemy shell adds functionality for hostility on the player shelled objects)
## new level object format
- objects -> every single object like netity, wall, trigger etc.
- links -> link to another level/location in level
- background -> data for the background used in the level
- extras -> extra level variables, modifiers etc.
